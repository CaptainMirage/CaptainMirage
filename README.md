# 🏴‍☠️ Hey there, my name is kami!

🛠️ I work with Python, C#, C++, C and rust.

🎮 I make games in Unity. Check them out on my [itch.io page](https://captain-mirage.itch.io/). (currently really empty, unless i forgot i made this comment and it isnt anymore)

⚓ I'm the incredibly handsome and charismatic founder of Captain's Deck Entertainment, and we're famous for two things: making broken games and breaking our own games.

🎛️ Be sure to swing by my [Dev YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@CaptainMirage) for devlogs and that come out once every 2 years!

📺 Also check out my [Gaming YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@CaptMirage) for vlogs (maybe), gaming content that is only containing apex currently (once every decade)!

## Let's talk and whatnot!

📫 Reach out to me at CaptainDecoys@proton.me and or captainmirage on discord if you have any questions or just want to chat. I'm always here for my fellow fans!
