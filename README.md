# 🏴‍☠️ Hey there, my name is Kami!

🛠️ I work with Python, C#, C++, C and rust.

🎮 I make games in Unity. Check them out on my [itch.io page](https://captain-mirage.itch.io/). (currently only foxy is there and i cant be f**ked to update it)

⚓ I'm the incredibly handsome and charismatic founder of Captain's Deck Entertainment, and we're famous for two things: making broken games and breaking our own games.

📡 Okay, maybe I'm not an expert programmer, but I'm definitely "the goodest".

🎛️ Be sure to swing by my [Dev YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@CaptainMirage) for devlogs and other funny stuff!

📺 Also check out my [Gaming YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@CaptMirage) for vlogs (maybe), gaming content, and hilarious deaths of mine in apex!

## Let's talk and whatnot!

📫 Reach out to me at elliottwittdamirage@gmail.com and or captainmirage on discord if you have any questions or just want to chat. I'm always here for my fellow fans!

## Current Projects

🚀 Right now, I'm working on Mirage's Mixtape, which is a YouTube video downloader! Keep an eye out for it.
