# 🎩 Hey there, fellow dev, im Mirage!

🛠️ I work with Python, C#, C++, Java, and a bit of Kotlin.

🎮 I make games in Unity. Check them out on my [itch.io page](https://captain-mirage.itch.io/), where I sprinkle a little Mirage lore too!

🏴‍☠️ I'm the incredibly handsome and charismatic founder of Captain's Deck Entertainment, and we're famous for two things: making totally awesome games and [insert cool reason here].

📡 Okay, maybe I'm not an expert programmer, but I'm definitely "the goodest".

📺 Be sure to swing by my [Dev YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@CaptainMirage) for vlogs, devlogs and other funny stuff!

📺 Also check out my [Gaming YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@CaptMirage) for vlogs (maybe), gaming content, and hilarious stuff.

## Current Projects

🚀 Right now, I'm working on Mirage's Mixtape, which is a YouTube video downloader! Keep an eye out for it.

## Let's talk and have a drink!
