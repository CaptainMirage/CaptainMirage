# 🎩 Hey there, my name is Kami!

🛠️ I work with Python, C#, C++, Java and rust.

🎮 I make games in Unity. Check them out on my [itch.io page](https://captain-mirage.itch.io/), (currently only foxy is there and i cant be ducked to update it)

🏴‍☠️ I'm the incredibly handsome and charismatic founder of Captain's Deck Entertainment, and we're famous for two things: making broken games and breaking our own games.

📡 Okay, maybe I'm not an expert programmer, but I'm definitely "the goodest".
