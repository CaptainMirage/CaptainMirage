# 🎩 Hey there, legends, it's me, the one and only Mirage!

I'm the fan-favorite, devilishly handsome guy from the adrenaline-pumping world of Apex Legends! You know, the game where I'm the life of the party!

🛠️ I know Python, C#, C++, JavaScript, TypeScript, and a bit of Kotlin.

🎮 I make games in Unity. Check them out on my [itch.io page](https://captain-mirage.itch.io/), where I sprinkle a little Mirage magic!

🏴‍☠️ I'm the incredibly handsome and charismatic founder of Captain's Deck Entertainment, and we're famous for two things: making totally awesome & legendary games and [insert cool reason here].

📡 Okay, maybe I'm not an expert programmer, but I'm definitely "the goodest".

📺 Be sure to swing by my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEi1Yl_QpYygxaLeJ3THdwA) for vlogs, gaming content, and all the hilarious antics!

## Current Projects

🚀 Right now, I'm working on Mirage's Mixtape, which is a YouTube video downloader! Keep an eye out for it.

## Let's talk and have a drink!
