# 🎩 Hey there, legends, it's me, the incredible Mirage!

I'm the fan-favorite, devilishly handsome guy from the adrenaline-pumping world of Apex Legends! You know, the game where I'm the life of the party!

🛠️ In my toolkit, I've got Python, C#, C++, JavaScript, TypeScript, and a hint of Kotlin. Just like in the arena, I'm here to bamboozle code like I bamboozle my enemies!

🎮 When I'm not bamboozling legends in the arena, I'm crafting epic games in Unity. Check 'em out on my [itch.io page](https://captain-mirage.itch.io/), where I sprinkle a little Mirage magic!

🏴‍☠️ I'm the incredibly handsome and charismatic founder of Captain's Deck Entertainment, and we're famous for two things: making legendary games and, well, being legends ourselves. It's all in a day's work for a guy as charming as me!

📡 Okay, maybe I'm not an expert coder, but I'm definitely "the goodest." As for looking good, you know I'm *dazzling*!

📺 Be sure to swing by my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEi1Yl_QpYygxaLeJ3THdwA) for vlogs, gaming content, and all the hilarious antics with my best buddy Wraith and the rest of the squad!

## Current Projects

🚀 Right now, I'm working on Captain's Shanty, which is a youtube video downloader! Keep an eye out for it.

📚 I'm also making an AI that is kind of jarvis kind of not, just trying to make a cortana kind of thing for windows

## Lets talk and have a drink!
